Veh File Generator/Organizer
version 1.0, release date 9/17/2018

The Excel veh file generator provides an alternative for those wishing to set up the participants
for an rFactor 2 race event, in a quicker and more consistent manner. 
Most of the automation algorithm options are structured primarily with AI single player 
racing in mind.

I recommend that users at least skim through the 2 PDF guides, to use the utility to
its proper & full potential. Guide I, was heavily revised after completing Guide II.

Feel free to redistribute this file as you may wish, but be sure to include this readme & guides.
If you wish to make modifications to the Microsoft Excel utility, feel free to do so, 
but please, document the changes.
